                    <p>High above the streets of Seoul, forty-five year old, Park Jong-sup has decided to end it all.
                        Bigoted, cruel and foul, he is the type of man the world may be better off without.
                        Watching him for some time though, is none other than Death herself, and she has other plans.
                        Ripping the privilege of death from the suicidal man, he falls from the building, only to scrape
                        himself from the pavement. Some may consider this a gift, to Jong-sup itâ€™s a curse.

                        With his new unwanted lease on life he must face the problems (and responsibilities) he sought
                        to escape head on. The journey to remedy his affliction will lead Jong-sup into contact with
                        violent gang members, an insane psychopath and one innocent but unfortunate young girl.
